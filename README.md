# DifficultProgrammingFeatures
A discussion on Reddit regarding features users would like but are frequently left out prompted my interest in collaborating to solve these problems once and for all for the good of the development community. Users want Excell, they want WYSIWYG, they want Dark Theme, and so much more, and we push back because of the time commitment. The goal of this repository is to address each of these problems in a way that is abstracted enough to be reusable in minutes to hours, rather than days. link to discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e8ex9v/things_end_users_care_about_but_programmers_dont/
